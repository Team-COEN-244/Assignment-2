Assignment - 2 - COEN 244
Environment : Visual Studio 2019

Our program contains 3 header files (Account, SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount) and 3 cpp files corresponding to each header file.
It also contains a tester file named Assignment_2.cpp which.
This programm is not difficult to use. 
The user is asked to first input the balance of his account.
Then he can do all the transactions he wants to until he writes "stop".
Then the program will create an account corresponding to the derived class SavingsAccount.
It askes the user to write the percentage of interest he has on his account and then the program calculates the interest amount for the user.
Then the program creates an other account corresponding to the derived class CheckingAccount.
The user has to input the taxes he has for this account (in $) and then he can do all the transactions he needs to do and the program will substract the amount of taxes.
If the user's account does not have enough money, an error message will be printed, and the debit transaction will not occur.
The user has to write "stop" to finish the program.
